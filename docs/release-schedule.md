# FEAST Release Schedule

FEAST follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification. The specification is in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
format, with releases prefixed with `v`. For example, `v1.2.4` is major release 1, minor release 2, patch release 4.

FEAST is not on a set release schedule for minor or patch releases. FEAST is uniquely positioned to release rapidly with
safety, due to the code coverage policy of 100% test coverage and static type inference
(see [Contributing to FEAST](CONTRIBUTING.md)). As such, new minor and patch releases are released when bugs are
found or new behavior is implemented.

FEAST attempts to align major releases with the PHP minor release schedule. Backwards compatibility breaks are
usually reserved for release on the day of PHP minor releases.
